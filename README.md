🧠 CyberArena
A Modular Cyber Simulation Cockpit with Red/Blue/Grey Organs and Cybernaut Pilots
CyberArena is a living, modular cyber‑simulation environment built in Python/Flask.
It models a full offensive–defensive–automation ecosystem using three core “organs”:
• 	Red Team — offensive simulations (recon, fuzzing, AI attack modeling)
• 	Blue Team — defensive simulations (log analysis, anomaly detection, zero‑trust scoring, deception)
• 	Grey Team — automation and hybrid logic (web bots, recon bots, task runners)
At the center sits the Cybernaut layer — symbolic pilots that will eventually coordinate and reason across all organs.
CyberArena is designed for:
• 	cybersecurity learning
• 	agent‑based simulation
• 	portfolio demonstration
• 	modular experimentation
• 	future AI‑driven cybernaut development

Pull requests welcome.
This project is intentionally modular — new organs, bots, or cybernaut behaviors can be added easily.
